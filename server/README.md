# Open Tutor backend

Two processes, both in this package:

- **Web service** (`open_tutor.web`, FastAPI): serves the built page from `web/dist`, and `POST /api/session` returns a short-lived LiveKit room token. The learner's name, school year and newest notes travel in the token's participant metadata. Nothing is stored on the server.
- **Tutor worker** (`open_tutor.agent`, LiveKit Agents): joins each room as `open-tutor`, runs Soniox speech recognition, the tutor model and the voice, and drives the board through the protocol in [docs/protocol.md](../docs/protocol.md).

## Run locally

```bash
cd server
uv sync --python 3.12
bin/with-env uv run python -m open_tutor.agent dev          # worker
bin/with-env uv run uvicorn open_tutor.web:app --port 8710   # web service
cd ../web && npm install && npm run dev                      # page on http://localhost:5173
```

`bin/with-env` loads `~/.config/open-tutor/env` (mode 600, never committed) as defaults (a variable already set in the environment wins) and, if that file names an Infisical project in `OPEN_TUTOR_INFISICAL_PROJECT`, injects provider keys from it. Other hosts can put every variable in the env file instead.

## The OpenCode Go route

Go serves Muse Spark 1.3 Contributor only on its OpenAI Responses endpoint, `https://opencode.ai/inference/go/openai/v1/responses`. Tested 2026-11-04 with fictional material:

- HTTP streaming works. The Responses WebSocket that LiveKit's plugin uses by default answers 404, so the worker uses HTTP (`use_websocket=False`).
- Function calls arrive as structured `function_call` items with complete JSON arguments. Spoken text arrives separately as `output_text`. Tool results are sent back as `function_call_output` in the full context (`store=false`, no `previous_response_id`).
- Image input (`input_image`, data URL) is read correctly.
- Go's usage block has no `cache_write_tokens`; LiveKit 1.8.10 failed every turn on that, so `tutor_llm.py` fills in 0.
- Requests name the app (`User-Agent: open-tutor/…`) and send the room name as `x-opencode-session`, as Go asks of clients.
- Reasoning `minimal`: board tool called in 24 of 24 first requests, median 1.4 s to first output (`low`: 4.2 s median, up to 11.6 s).
- Go's documentation says Muse Spark Contributor prompts and completions are used to train Meta models (not zero data retention), and the workspace must allow paid endpoints that train on request data.

## Configuration

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `LIVEKIT_URL`, `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` | LiveKit Cloud project (required) |
| `SONIOX_API_KEY` | Speech recognition, Swedish hint |
| `TUTOR_TTS` | `elevenlabs` (default) or `cartesia` |
| `TUTOR_TTS_VOICE`, `TUTOR_TTS_MODEL` | Voice id and model for that provider |
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` / `CARTESIA_API_KEY` | Voice provider key |
| `TUTOR_LLM` | `go` (default): Muse Spark 1.3 Contributor (`muse-spark-1.3-contributor`) on OpenCode Go, Responses API over HTTP streaming, `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY`. `gemini-dev` only reproduces the board/voice bug of the earlier development route (`GEMINI_API_KEY`); do not deploy it. There is no silent fallback. |
| `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY` | OpenCode Go API key (from the OpenCode console). Backend only |
| `TUTOR_LLM_MODEL`, `TUTOR_LLM_BASE_URL`, `TUTOR_LLM_REASONING` | Override the route's model, endpoint or reasoning effort (Go default `minimal`) |
| `TUTOR_AGENT_NAME` | Dispatch name, default `open-tutor`. Give a test worker and its web service another name so it never takes a family session |
| `EXA_API_KEY` | Resource search |
| `TUTOR_ACCESS_CODE` | Optional family code. When set, the page asks for it once per browser |
| `TUTOR_MAX_SESSIONS_PER_HOUR` | Owner spending cap across the instance (default 12) |
| `TUTOR_CLOUD_RECORDING` | `1` uploads session audio and transcripts to LiveKit Cloud observability. Off by default |
| `TUTOR_STT_MAX_ENDPOINT_MS`, `TUTOR_MIN_ENDPOINT` | Turn-taking tuning for pauses while a child thinks |

## Tests

```bash
uv run pytest -q
```

`scripts/two_session_probe.py` runs two consecutive typed sessions for one fictional learner against a running worker. The first session's saved note goes into the second, as in the browser. It checks that board items arrive and are acknowledged in both, and that no tool name, arguments or JSON reach the captions (the text the voice speaks).

`scripts/diagram_browser_probe.py` checks the diagram card in a real browser: the real `Tutor` tools drive a Chromium page through a local LiveKit server (`livekit-server --dev`), with no model, voice or cloud account. It verifies what the browser drew (labels, arrows, focus, ordering, text alternative, lazy-load and font failures, reconnection) and writes screenshots. See [docs/diagram-card.md](../docs/diagram-card.md). It needs Playwright and is not part of CI.

`scripts/live_probe.py` runs a real session against a running worker with a scripted fictional learner: recorded Swedish clips, a generated worksheet, an interruption, 30 s of quiet work, mumbling, and the end of the session. It writes a JSON timeline and the tutor's audio. It uses live providers and costs a little; it is not part of CI.
